in pyhton there are 5 types of variable
integer - we know integers
float - we know floats too
char/strings- we know char/strings too

new types
1] boolyeans - they are the keywords which are true or false
Not much information about booleans still

2] none - a keyword which might be used in future
does keep an variable,float,character etc empty
not much information about none too
