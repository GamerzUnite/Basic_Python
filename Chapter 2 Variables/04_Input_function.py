'''Input function to get value from user'''
#(LEARNED)

a = input("Enter the value of a: ") 
# input is taken as string this is same as scanf
#but in a shortcut way
a = int(a)#type casting done
b = -2 #variable -2 
print(a+b) # arithmetic operation done
# if type casting is not done the operation
# will not work
