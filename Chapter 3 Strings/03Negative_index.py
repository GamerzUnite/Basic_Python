'''NEGATIVE INDEX'''#(LEARNED)

a = "GamerzWorld"
print(a[-2])

#negative index can be used to get the directly the
# last index easily if the programer just want
# the last index but dont know the length of string
# so tp save time we can use negative index to get
# directly at the last index 
# we can even say negative index works in an 
# desending order

'''May check the Output to know about it'''
# BUT NOW I KNOW IT NOICE
